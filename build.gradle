So Lets see what task can do
By the way here a task is a self contained unit of work that gradle can reason about.
So here task can have a group, description and closure.
Oh wait what is closure?
Techinally, from formal documentation:
A closure in Groovy is an open, anonymous, block of code that can take arguments, return a value and be assigned to a variable
Means you can do anything with it. literally anything.
So lets get into a task

So lets run and see what happens now
:) Do it yourself
